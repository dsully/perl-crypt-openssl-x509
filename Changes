- Correction to spelling found Debian Linter, thanks @fschlich

- Added eliminated compound-token-split-by-macro errors coming from newer clang/LLVM version (>11?), got some good pointers from this Perl issue https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18780

- Forced OpenSSL under Homebrew to 1.1 via openssl\@1.1, since OpenSSL version 3 got released we might experience issues and this need to be revisited and tested thoroughly

- Reformatted the Changes file, slowly converting to Markdown

1.9.10 Sun Aug  1 09:48:08 CEST 2021

- MANIFEST was not updated with the latest contributions from 1.9.9

  REF: https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/issues/89

1.9.9 Sat Jul 31 17:58:56 CEST 2021

- Contribution by Patrick Cernko. The email method has been extended to return multiple email addresses if available.

  REF: https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/pull/88

1.9.8 Thu May 13 18:04:17 CEST 2021

1.9.7 Sun May  2 19:36:24 CEST 2021

- Addressed minor issue with META.yml file not reporting correct version, see issue #86

  REF: https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/issues/86

1.9.6 Sat Apr 24 09:17:00 CEST 2021

- I fell over the CPAN release checklist at https://github.com/Tux/Release-Checklist/blob/master/Checklist.md it mentions
  Devel::PPPort https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::PPPort. I have now put this to use, raised a single warning

  *** WARNING: Uses is_utf8_string_loclen, which may not be portable below perl 5.9.3, even with 'ppport.h'
  *** Uses 5 C++ style comments, which is not portable
  Analysis completed (1 warning)

  And provided as single patch, which has now been applied and C++ style comments have been changed to C style comments

1.9.5 Thu Apr 22 07:32:16 CEST 2021

- I broke the build for Linux

  - CPAN testers reports: http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=Crypt-OpenSSL-X509+1.904

    The issue is that the change introduced in 1.9.4 introduces an option, which is LLVM specific
    and is not understood by GCC.

    See also issue: #84, ref: https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/issues/84

    I have rearranged the use of flags and try with a match on the GCC version string, which
    can contain the substring LLVM

1.9.4 Wed Apr 21 07:45:58 CEST 2021

- Made a minor change to the Makefile.PL addressing issue with breaking builds on FreeBSD and OpenBSD

  For Perl versions below or equal to 5.20, the error:

  error: nonnull parameter 'pv' will evaluate to 'true' on first encounter [-Werror,-Wpointer-bool-conversion]
  if (pv && len > 1) {

  Has been observed this is now suppressed with converting the error handling into a warning

  See CPAN testers reports:
