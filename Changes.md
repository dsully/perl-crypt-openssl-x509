## 1.9.14 2022-05-03

- Applied PR [#109](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/pull/108) from @ikedas fixing a bug found in 1.9.14-TRIAL, where the wrong API was called, propably due to a typo in the name

- Applied PR [#108](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/pull/108) from @skaji a bug found in 1.9.14-TRIAL, where a possible interpolatation was probibited due to quoting

- Applied patch from @ikedas PR [#105](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/pull/105) make the pattern match for LLVM version number in the 12 series a bit more liberal. This was followed up by PR [#107](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/pull/107) by @jonasbn

- Applied patch from @timlegge PR [#102](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/pull/102) adressing issues: [#45](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/issues/45) and [#95](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/issues/95) with only a more strict use of compiler flags if environment variable `AUTHOR_TESTING` is set to true

- Added enhancement from @michal-josef-spacek introducing use of [Crypt::OpenSSL::Guess](https://metacpan.org/pod/Crypt::OpenSSL::Guess), which can be used to determine placement of OpenSSL libraries via PR [#104](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/pull/104). The idea originates from issue [#97](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/issues/97) raised by @ikedas and addresses: [#94](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/issues/94) also from @ikedas

- The above was followed up by a PR from @jonasbn [#106](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/pull/106) enabling installation of `configure` section for CI jobs for both `cpanm` and `cpm`

- Metadata on bug tracker was updated with release 1.9.13, documentation updated with this release. Addressing issue [#80](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/issues/80) raised by @skaji, update by @jonasbn

- Patch from @timlegge via PR [#103](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/pull/103) improving handling of OpenSSL API versions

- Patch from @skaji via PR [#100](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/pull/100) making use of constants in XS code

- Forced OpenSSL under Homebrew to 1.1 via `openssl\@1.1`, since OpenSSL version 3 got released we might experience issues and this need to be revisited and tested thoroughly

- Reformatted the Changes file, slowly converting to Markdown

## 1.9.10 2021-08-01

- MANIFEST was not updated with the latest contributions from 1.9.9, see issue [#89](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/issues/89)

## 1.9.9 2021-07-31

- Contribution by Patrick Cernko. The email method has been extended to return multiple email addresses if available.
  The addresses are concatenated using space (' ') as seperator in order for consumers to extract the multiple email addresses, see PR [#88](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/pull/88)

## 1.9.8 2021-05-13

## 1.9.7 2021-05-02

- Addressed minor issue with META.yml file not reporting correct version, see issue [#86](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/issues/86)

## 1.9.6 2021-04-24

- I fell over this [CPAN release checklist](https://github.com/Tux/Release-Checklist/blob/master/Checklist.md), it mentions
  [Devel::PPPort](https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::PPPort). I have now put this to use, raised a single warning

  ```text
  *** WARNING: Uses is_utf8_string_loclen, which may not be portable below perl 5.9.3, even with 'ppport.h'
  *** Uses 5 C++ style comments, which is not portable
  Analysis completed (1 warning)
  ```

  And provided as single patch, which has now been applied and C++ style comments have been changed to C style comments

## 1.9.5 2021-04-22

- I broke the build for Linux

  - [CPAN testers reports](http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=Crypt-OpenSSL-X509+1.904)

    The issue is that the change introduced in 1.9.4 introduces an option, which is LLVM specific
    and is not understood by GCC.

    See also issue: [#84](https://github.com/dsully/perl-crypt-openssl-x509/issues/84)

    I have rearranged the use of flags and try with a match on the GCC version string, which
    can contain the substring LLVM

## 1.9.4 2021-04-21

- Made a minor change to the Makefile.PL addressing issue with breaking builds on FreeBSD and OpenBSD

  For Perl versions below or equal to 5.20, the error:

  ```text
  error: nonnull parameter 'pv' will evaluate to 'true' on first encounter [-Werror,-Wpointer-bool-conversion]
  if (pv && len > 1) {
  ```

  Has been observed this is now suppressed with converting the error handling into a warning

  See CPAN testers reports: [1](http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/119b4298-9e42-11eb-84bc-edd243e66a77), [2](http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/77bdcdd2-a0e7-11eb-84bc-edd243e66a77) and [3](http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/fd7e66b6-a14b-11eb-84bc-edd243e66a77)
